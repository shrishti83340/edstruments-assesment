##  Question 2 ‚Äì SQL and Database Design

All tasks for *Question 2* have been completed and included in the project.

üìÑ A file named *ecommerce_schema.sql* is located in the *root directory* of this project.  
This file contains:
- SQL CREATE TABLE statements for the required E-commerce schema (User, Product, Order, OrderItem)
- Sample INSERT statements with example data
- All SQL queries and logic as requested in the task prompt

The schema reflects the following relationships:
- A User can have many Orders
- An Order can have many OrderItems
- Each OrderItem is associated with one Product

You can open and run the ecommerce_schema.sql file to view the complete database setup and query solutions.
